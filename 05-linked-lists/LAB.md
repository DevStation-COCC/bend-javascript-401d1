====

## To Submit this Assignment
  * Do all your work in a public repository called `data-structures-and-algorithms`
  * write all of your code in a directory named `linked-lists`
  * push to your repository
  * submit a pull request to this repository
  * submit a link to your PR in canvas
  * write a question and observation on canvas

## Requirements  
#### Configuration  
  <!-- list of files, configurations, tools, etc that are required -->
  Your lab directory must include  
  * **index.js** -- The entry point to your module
  * **README.md** -- with a documentation about your lab
  * **.gitignore** -- with a robust .gitignore
  * **.eslintrc** -- with the class .eslintrc file
  * **.eslintignore** -- with the class .eslintignore
  * **.travis.yml** -- travis-ci instructions
  * **.package.json** -- with all dependencies and dev-dependencies
  * **lib/** -- directory for holding your programs helper modules
  * **__tests__/** -- directory for holding your programs unit and integration tests

#### Testing  
  * write at least three test assertions for each method of the Singly Linked List Data Structure
  * organize your tests into appropriate describe/it blocks for test output readability

####  Documentation  
  * in your README, write documentation for you data structures
  * your documentation should includes code block useage examples
  * provide instructions for:
    * installing and using your data structure
    * accessing each method
    * running your tests

#### Feature Tasks  
* implement a Singly Linked List (SLL) data structure
* implement `append(value)`, `prepend(value)`, `reverse()`, and `remove(offset)` methods to the SLL class
* implement `serialize()` and `deserialize()` methods on the class
* in a comment within each function, note the it's Big-O runtime
